Thesis research project/experiment for my MSc in Neuroeconomics: The effect of adhd tendencies on intertemporal choices
In this experiment we measure the participants probability to have ADHD with a self report questionnaire. I also use an intertemporal choice game combined with mouselabweb's mousetracking to track visual attention of the participants
